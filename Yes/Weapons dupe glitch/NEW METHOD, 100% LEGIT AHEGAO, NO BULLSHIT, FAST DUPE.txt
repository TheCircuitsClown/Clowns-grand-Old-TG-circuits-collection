SUPER SAYIAN, ULTIMATE GUIDE HOW TO GET CIRCUITS REMOVED, ALSO TO GET YOUR BALLS REMOVED BY ADMIN IF YOU WILL ABUSE IT AS A BONUS

You have... A laser pistol in one hand, a Weapon Firing Circuit module in another hand (yeah, not even installed)
You tap pistol on circuit assembly, a menu with weapon circuits where you wanna insert gun will pop up (it happens if theres more than 2 weapon circuits in assembly)
And.. You put pistol in weapon circuit in your hand instead, then select any circuit in the pop up menu.
What did just happen? Your circuit, is inside your circuit assembly, and in circuit in your hand.
Empty circuit in your hand, and select assembly again, and repeat it over, and over, and over.
Now your circuit has for example, 5 weapon circuits, with duped guns in em, and you still have your pistol too.
