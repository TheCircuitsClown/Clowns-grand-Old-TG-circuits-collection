I made the self healers circuits awhile ago, and they share 1 issue, some inject too fast - and you get OD, some inject too slow, - and you die, and get OD.
I mean, you can make single use injector which gonna be 100% safe. Like limited amounth of chemicals, that inject once and them it wont inject until you restart circuit
Or, make it inject like 3 units each second, and never get OD.
So yeah it can be fixed but im a lazy motherfucker :P
