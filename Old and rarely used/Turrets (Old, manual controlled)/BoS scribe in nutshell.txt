 get bullied by knights and do their job. You set up all machiney, by replacing stock parts, thats first thing to do, but because knights dont like mining you will also mine ore to print the stock parts and your lovely sonic jackhammer for faster mining. To be giga chad scribe, you can find Pristine General atomics toaster in lab, where the weapon parts and power armour racks located, the toaster is in wooden crate, crowsbar it, and use crewdriver on that toaster. GG you have the stockparts for ORM, now get RPED and max ORM, then you can dump ore in it and get max points and ore per sheet. Good job, you have ore, but your getting shitty amounth of points for researches. What do you do? You open Circuits tab in your lab computer and find R&D console board for computer, replace the BoS archive board with this one, and good job, you get 2100 points instead of 400 each minute. Now you can research shit faster. Eventually paladin will want to fuck you up, because you are bad scribe and havent made his synthtissue, why? Because paladins addicted to weird chemicals that can heal corpses, dont ask. To make this funny thing make get synthflesh and sugar with 1 to 1 ratio and shove in heater, keep temperature at 320 and when it will begin brewing you can pull out beaker and leave it somewhere. Good job, now make stimfluid and plant mutfruits. Done it? You are certified scribe now, be happy.
