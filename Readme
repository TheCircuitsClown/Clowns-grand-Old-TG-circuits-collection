Welcome to my humble shithole.
You can find all kinds of autistic unbalanceable Space Station 13, Old TG integrated circuits
Most of them dont have description, are copies of each other(slight modifications), outdated(broken) or not finished as I didnt plan to share them before.
Some circuits have description, however for the most you will have to print em, check modules and figure shit out.
