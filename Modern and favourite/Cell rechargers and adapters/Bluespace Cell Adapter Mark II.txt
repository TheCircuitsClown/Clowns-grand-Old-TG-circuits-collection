It charges cells for your guns, while cells are inside your guns. How to use adapter? Pull cell out of your gun, and tap it on adapter chasis to let it target your weapon cell, then install cell back in gun, now its fueld by adapter. Whats the *adapters cell charge* screen? It shows amounth of bluespace cell charge left in percents. What if adapter cell is emprty? Then adapter will stop charging your weapon cell, give adapter to your scientist to recharge adapter."]]},{"type":"button","name":"Show User Manual For Five Seconds"},{"type":"five-sec delay circuit","name":"Clear Manual Scren"}],"wires":[[[1,"I",1],[2,"O",1]],[[1,"A",1],[3,"A",1]],[[2,"O",1],[9,"I",1]],[[2,"O",1],[10,"I",1]],[[2,"A",1],[10,"A",1]],[[3,"I",1],[5,"O",1]],[[4,"I",1],[10,"O",1]],[[4,"A",1],[9,"A",1]],[[5,"I",1],[9,"O",3]],[[5,"A",1],[9,"A",2]],[[6,"I",1],[7,"O",3]],[[6,"A",1],[7,"A",2]],[[7,"A",1],[8,"A",1]],[[11,"I",1],[12,"O",1]],[[11,"I",1],[13,"O",1]],[[11,"A",1],[12,"A",2]],[[11,"A",1],[13,"A",2]],[[12,"A",1],[15,"A",2]],[[13,"A",1],[14,"A",1]],[[14,"A",1],[15,"A",1]]]}
