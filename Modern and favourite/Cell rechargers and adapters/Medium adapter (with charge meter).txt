What it does? It automatically recharges your weapon energy weapon cells. How good it is? Its amazing, you can install 40MJ b-space cell and your weapon will be shooting for long time without need of replacing cells midcombat. How to use it? It is a new version with medium size, it got way more complexed than it was, so listen carefully. First of all, you install any power cell inside to start it up. Then you toggle numpad, and write 1 and press OK. Now, grab b-space cell, and scan it. It will be remembered as cell 1, and you will see its charge now. Now you remove cell from assembly you used to start it up, and install that bluespace cell you just scanned. All is set up, and now you use numpad and enter 2 and use any energy weapon cell you wish to be charging. Now you can carry this in your bag, but remember bluesspace cell replacement got longer, tho you see the charge, think, when you need to replace your cell."},{"type":"text-to-speech circuit","name":"Starting Up.","inputs":[[1,0,"Hello user, this is the portable medium sized bluespace adapter.
